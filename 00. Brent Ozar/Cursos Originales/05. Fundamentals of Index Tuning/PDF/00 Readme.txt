This class is being simulcast on YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook, but I won't be
taking questions on any of those platforms. That's just for watching the video.
To ask questions or chat, you *have* to be in Slack.



== CLASS PREREQUISITES ==

Before this class, watch my free How to Think Like the Engine course:
https://www.brentozar.com/training/think-like-sql-server-engine/



== RUNNING THE DEMOS ==

To follow along with the demos, download a Stack Overflow database. 
https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/10/how-to-download-the-stack-overflow-database-via-bittorrent/

I'll be using the medium-sized 50GB StackOverflow2013 database, but if you've 
got a different one handy (either the smaller 10GB or larger 300+GB one),
that's fine too - the same concepts will still apply. If you're on a slow 
desktop/laptop, feel free to use the small 10GB StackOverflow2010 database.

Attach it to any supported version of SQL Server, can be Standard, Enterprise, 
or Developer. (Sorry, SQL Server 2008 and Express Edition won't cut it here.) 
If you want a free development or evaluation version of SQL Server, hit up 
https://SQLServerUpdates.com.


Enjoy the class!
Brent
