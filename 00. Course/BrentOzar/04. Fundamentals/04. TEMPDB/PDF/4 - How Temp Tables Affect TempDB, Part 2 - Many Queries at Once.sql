/*
Fundamentals of TempDB: How Temp Tables Affect TempDB, Part 2: Many Queries at Once
v1.0 - 2020-12-06
https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/tempdbfun


This demo requires:
* SQL Server 2016 or newer
* Any Stack Overflow database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack

This first RAISERROR is just to make sure you don't accidentally hit F5 and
run the entire script. You don't need to run this:
*/
RAISERROR(N'Oops! No, don''t just hit F5. Run these demos one at a time.', 20, 1) WITH LOG;
GO

/* If you're on SQL Server 2019, check to make
sure this returns a 0: */
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('IsTempDBMetadataMemoryOptimized');
GO
/* If it returns a 1, let's turn this feature off
for now in order to demo SQL Server's traditional
problem in TempDB: */
ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED TEMPDB_METADATA=OFF;
/* And you'll then need to restart SQL Server. */


/* Before we start, review the number of files
we've got in TempDB: */
SELECT type_desc, name, physical_name, 
	size * 8.0 / 1024 AS size_mb
	FROM tempdb.sys.database_files
	ORDER BY type_desc DESC;


USE StackOverflow2013;
GO
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.TempTable AS
	SELECT TOP 1000 Id, AboutMe
	INTO #t1
	FROM dbo.Users WITH (NOLOCK)
	OPTION (MAXDOP 1);
GO

/* When you run just one, it's quick: */
SET STATISTICS TIME, IO ON;
GO
EXEC TempTable;

/* But run that in SQLQueryStress on a lot of 
threads while we measure: */
EXEC sp_BlitzFirst @ExpertMode = 1, @Seconds = 60;
EXEC sp_WhoIsActive;
GO




/* What if we try table variables? */
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.TableVariable AS
BEGIN
	DECLARE @TableVariable TABLE (Id INT, AboutMe NVARCHAR(MAX));

	INSERT INTO @TableVariable (Id, AboutMe)
	SELECT TOP 1000 Id, AboutMe
	FROM dbo.Users WITH (NOLOCK)
	OPTION (MAXDOP 1);
END
GO


/* Try just one: */
SET STATISTICS TIME, IO ON;
GO
EXEC TableVariable;

/* Then run it in SQLQueryStress on a lot of threads. */
EXEC sp_BlitzFirst @ExpertMode = 1, @Seconds = 60;
EXEC sp_WhoIsActive;
GO


/* SQL Server 2019 brings a new system-level
feature to help solve this: */
ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED TEMPDB_METADATA=ON;
/* Restart the SQL Server instance for it to take
effect, then check it: */
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('IsTempDBMetadataMemoryOptimized');
GO

/* Then run both the TempTable and TableVariable
load tests again while watching page latch waits. */
EXEC sp_BlitzFirst @ExpertMode = 1, @Seconds = 60;
EXEC sp_WhoIsActive;
GO


/* Turn this back off for the lab: */
ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED TEMPDB_METADATA=OFF;
/* Restart the SQL Server instance for it to take
effect, then check it: */
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('IsTempDBMetadataMemoryOptimized');
GO

/* During the break, check your production servers
to see how many files they have: */
SELECT type_desc, name, physical_name, 
	size * 8.0 / 1024 AS size_mb
	FROM tempdb.sys.database_files
	ORDER BY type_desc DESC;
GO
/* And look for PAGELATCH waits amongst your top 10,
indicating that you may need more files (or a
code change): */
sp_BlitzFirst @OutputType = 'Top10'

/* Not PAGEIOLATCH% or LATCH% - we're specifically
looking for PAGELATCH%. */
