/*
Fundamentals of TempDB: How Execution Plans Use TempDB
v1.0 - 2020-12-06
https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/tempdbfun


This demo requires:
* SQL Server 2016 or newer
* Any Stack Overflow database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack

This first RAISERROR is just to make sure you don't accidentally hit F5 and
run the entire script. You don't need to run this:
*/
RAISERROR(N'Oops! No, don''t just hit F5. Run these demos one at a time.', 20, 1) WITH LOG;
GO
USE StackOverflow2013;
GO
/* Use the newest compat level your server supports,
but not SQL Server 2019 yet.
130 = 2016, 140 = 2017. */
ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 130;
GO
DropIndexes;
GO
CREATE INDEX IX_OwnerUserId ON dbo.Posts(OwnerUserId) INCLUDE (Score, Title);
GO



CREATE OR ALTER PROC dbo.usp_UsersInTopLocation AS
BEGIN
WITH TopLocation AS (SELECT TOP 1 Location
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location <> ''
  GROUP BY Location
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)
SELECT u.*
  FROM TopLocation
    INNER JOIN dbo.Users u ON TopLocation.Location = u.Location
  ORDER BY DisplayName;
END
GO
 
/* Run this with actual plans on: */
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE;

EXEC usp_UsersInTopLocation
GO
/* Things to discuss:

* Estimates vs actuals through query
* Memory grant: ____ KB
* Memory used: ____ KB
* How many operators spilled

Run it again. Do things improve? 



To find queries having the problem, turn off actual plans and run:
*/
sp_BlitzCache @SortOrder = 'spills'
/* Things to note:
* Memory grant: granted, used
* Spills: min, max, total, avg

In this case, adding more memory won't help:
the query just doesn't want enough memory.

To learn a few ways to fix it with index & query
tuning, watch my Fundamentals of Query Tuning:
https://BrentOzar.com/go/queryfund


SQL Server 2019 has a way to fix it though:
*/
ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL = 150;
ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION SET LAST_QUERY_PLAN_STATS = ON;
GO
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE;

EXEC usp_UsersInTopLocation
GO
/* Things to discuss:

* Estimates vs actuals through query
* Memory grant: ____ KB (is this higher?)
* Memory used: ____ KB
* How many operators spilled

Now we have a different problem:
we got granted too much memory!

Try running it a few more times to see
if it gets better/worse: */
EXEC usp_UsersInTopLocation
GO 10

/* Turn off actual plans: */
sp_BlitzCache;
GO
/* Look at these columns:
* Minimum Memory Grant KB
* Maximum Memory Grant KB

* Minimum Used Grant KB
* Maximum Used Grant KB

* Spills - min, max, total, avg


That's a query that behaves the same way every
time because it doesn't have parameters. If we
use a more complex proc:
*/
CREATE OR ALTER PROC dbo.usp_UsersByReputation @Reputation INT AS
    SELECT TOP 100000 u.Id, p.Title, p.Score
        FROM dbo.Users u
        JOIN dbo.Posts p ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id
        WHERE u.Reputation = @Reputation
        ORDER BY p.Score DESC;
GO
 
/* And run it: */
DBCC FREEPROCCACHE;

/* Turn on actual plans: */ 
EXEC usp_UsersByReputation @Reputation = 1;
GO
 
 
 
/* Check out that adaptive join:
* Adaptive threshold in tooltip
* Over threshold: do an index scan
* Under: do a seek

* Also, note that nothing spills.
 
Try another reputation: */
EXEC usp_UsersByReputation @Reputation = 2;
GO
/* It chooses the seek, but...we have a yellow bang.

SQL Server is about to adjust the memory grant
downwards because we left too much unused. Try
it again: */
EXEC usp_UsersByReputation @Reputation = 2;

/* And the memory grant goes down.

But now try the big one again: */
EXEC usp_UsersByReputation @Reputation = 1;
GO


/* Turn OFF actual plans, and: */
sp_BlitzCache
/* Look at the:

* Query plan - last actual plan enabled
* Min/max memory grants
* Spills (!!!)
*/


/* Takeaways from this:

* This TempDB consumer is particularly hard to
  predict: it's different on a query-by-query
  basis, and changes with SQL Server versions.

* Microsoft's trying to make it better with
  adaptive memory grants, but right now, it's
  worse instead of better.

* To look for queries causing spills, run: 
  sp_BlitzCache @SortOrder = 'spills'

* In their plans, look for:
  * Sorts
  * Hash matches
  * Adaptive joins

During the break, check your own production
server's plan cache to see which queries have
been spilling the most to disk:
*/
sp_BlitzCache @SortOrder = 'spills';
GO
/* And scroll across to the Total Spills column. */
