Fundamentals of Parameter Sniffing
What Triggers Parameter Sniffing Emergencies, Part 2

This demo requires:
* SQL Server 2016 or newer
* 50GB Stack Overflow 2013 database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack

This first RAISERROR is just to make sure you don't accidentally hit F5 and
run the entire script. You don't need to run this:
*/
RAISERROR(N'Oops! No, don''t just hit F5. Run these demos one at a time.', 20, 1) WITH LOG;
GO


/* Continue this demo after running the prior module.
  We're reusing the same setups from there.

These 3 are specialized: let's demo the first two and talk about the 3rd.

* Plan cache pressure due to unparameterized queries
* Memory pressure
* Plans aging out
