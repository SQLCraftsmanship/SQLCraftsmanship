            1.2 What's my Frontend look like
            1.3 What database I am going to use
            1.4 What OS I am going to use
            1.5 General components I will need
            1.6 Create a Github

    Physical solution
        1. Use module and package
        2. Organize the import. In big projects it's important

            1.1 Name of the folder in lower case
            1.2 Name of the file in UpperCase
        2. Have a folder with name [backend]
        3. Have a folder with name [frontend]
             3.1 Create [src] folder
                3.1.1 Create [screens] folder and separate in folders
                3.1.2 Create [tests] folder
             3.2 Create [assets] folder
                3.2.1 Create [gifs] folder
                3.2.2 Create [images] folder
        4. Have a folder with name [db]
        5. Have a folder with name [libs]
            5.1 Create a helper folder and a [helper.py] file with information about each function
