Comparison operators 

In Python are used to compare two values, and they return a Boolean result (True or False) depending on whether the comparison is true or false.
Here are the comparison operators in Python along with official descriptions, examples, and exercises for each:

    Equality (==): Checks if two values are equal.
        Example:
            x = 5
            y = 5
            result = x == y  # result will be True

        Exercise:
        Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
            10 == 5
            3 == "3"

            
    Inequality (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
        Example:
            x = 5
            y = 10
            result = x != y  # result will be True

        Exercise:
        Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
            7 != 7
            "apple" != "banana"

    
    Greater Than (>): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
        Example:
            x = 10
            y = 5
            result = x > y  # result will be True

        Exercise:
            Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
            15 > 10
            3 > 3

    Less Than (<): Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
        Example:
            x = 5
            y = 10
            result = x < y  # result will be True

        Exercise:
        Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
            2 < 7
            10 < 5

    
    Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
        Example:
            x = 10
            y = 10
        result = x >= y  # result will be True

    Exercise:
        Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
            12 >= 10
            8 >= 15

    Less Than or Equal To (<=): Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
        Example:
        x = 5
        y = 5
        result = x <= y  # result will be True
    Exercise:
        Determine if the following expressions are True or False:
        3 <= 5
        10 <= 8
